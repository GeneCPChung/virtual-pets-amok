	//instance variable for litter box. create a method to calculate based on how many cats are in the shelter

VirtualPet class and related subclasses/interfaces	
-	 	Create a model that allows for dogs and cats, either of which may be robotic
-		Introduce an attribute (instance variable) representing overall health that 		is updated as a result of other attributes moving in a negative or positive 		direction, influencing happiness

	introduce methods that allow for:

- DONE  oiling robotic pets
-    	walking dogs, decreasing the likelihood that organic dogs will soil their 		cages, while increasing happiness in all dogs

	do not allow:
-	    feeding/watering robotic pets
-	    oiling organic pets

-		modify the tick method to return a value indicating the amount of waste a pet	creates, which should contribute to either:

-	    amount of waste in the litter box
-	    amount of waste in an individual dog cage

VirtualPetShelter class

In addition to the last project's requirements:

    introduce methods that allow for:
-       oiling/maintaining all robotic pets
-       cleaning dog cages
-       emptying the litterbox

-	    modify existing methods to only feed/water pets that are not robotic

VirtualPetShelterApp class

In addition to the last project's requirements:

    add options to:
-        walk all dogs
-       clean dog cages
-       clean the shelter litterbox
-       oil all robotic pets
