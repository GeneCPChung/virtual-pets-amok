	//instance variable for litter box. create a method to calculate based on how many cats are in the shelter

VirtualPet class and related subclasses/interfaces	
-	 	Create a model that allows for dogs and cats, either of which may be robotic
-		Introduce an attribute (instance variable) representing overall health that is updated as a result of other attributes moving in a negative or positive 		direction, influencing happiness

	introduce methods that allow for:

- DONE  oiling robotic pets
- DONE	walking dogs, decreasing the likelihood that organic dogs will soil their cages, while increasing happiness in all dogs

	do not allow:
- DONE  feeding/watering robotic pets
- DONE	oiling organic pets

- DONE	modify the tick method to return a value indicating the amount of waste a pet creates, which should contribute to either:

- DONE  amount of waste in the litter box
- DONE  amount of waste in an individual dog cage

VirtualPetShelter class

In addition to the last project's requirements:

    introduce methods that allow for:
- DONE  oiling/maintaining all robotic pets
- DONE  cleaning dog cages
- DONE	emptying the litterbox

- DONE  modify existing methods to only feed/water pets that are not robotic

VirtualPetShelterApp class

In addition to the last project's requirements:

    add options to:
-       walk all dogs
-       clean dog cages
-       clean the shelter litterbox
-       oil all robotic pets
